`check-update` checks for any updates to NativePHP. It verifies the version you have installed against
the version that is available. If there is a newer version available, it will let you know.

This command will not perform an update.

## Command

Syntax:

```bash
nativecli check-update [OPTIONS]
```

## Options

### -f, --format
By default, update status is output in `text`. For programmatic use, `json` is also a valid option:

```bash
nativecli check-update --format json
```
