description: "Create your first NativePHP project using NativeCLI"
---

This tutorial assumes that you have already followed the [Installation](/getting-started/installation) guide.

## Before you start

Make sure that:
- NativeCLI has been [installed](/getting-started/installation)
- NativeCLI is in your path and available for use:
  ```bash
  nativecli --version
  # Output: NativePHP CLI Tool x.x.x
  ```
  <Note>Version number may vary depending on your installed version</Note>

## Starting a new NativePHP Project

At this time, NativePHP only supports Laravel. For this reason, so does NativeCLI.

NativeCLI utilises Laravel's Installer library. This means that any arguments available within that is also available within NativeCLI.

<Note>
  This tutorial assumes that you will be creating your project in a `~/Code` directory in your user home.
</Note>

1. Execute the following command in the terminal:

   ```bash
   cd ~/Code
   nativecli new MyFirstProject
   ```
   
   <img src="/images/new_command.png" alt="New Command Example" />

2. You'll be prompted to select some options from the Laravel installer. Choose your favorites!

   <img src="/images/laravel_prompt.png" alt="Laravel Prompt" />

3. That's it! You'll find a new folder with your project name. It includes everything you need to get started.
